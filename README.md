## Setup

- Two files will need to be created in order for psql to be able to connect to the correct databases, these files should be located in the root of your repository.
- Create a file called .env.test and inside this file there should be PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
- Create a file called .env.development and inside this file there should be PGDATABASE=nc_games

Don't forget to seed your databases after completing these steps!
